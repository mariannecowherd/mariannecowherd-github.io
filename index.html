	<p> I am a first-year graduate student in the UC Berkeley <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science,
		Policy, and Management Department</a>, where I study fires and hydrology.
		I graduated from Stanford University in
		2019 with a B.S. in Environmental Systems Engineering and an M.S. in
		Environmental Engineering.</p>
	<p> At Stanford, I was advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fringer/">Oliver Fringer</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-monismith">Stephen Monismith</a> in the
		<a href="https://cee.stanford.edu/research/labs-centers/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory"> Bob & Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory</a>, where I worked
		on oscillatory wave-current boundary layers.</p>
	<p> I enjoy running, backpacking, and making science-themed crosswords. I'm
		also big on outreach and teaching, which I do at <a href="https://jrbp.stanford.edu/"> Jasper Ridge
		Biological Preserve</a>, <a href="http://outercoast.org/">Outer Coast</a>, and <a href="https://www.mircore.org/">miRcore</a>.
